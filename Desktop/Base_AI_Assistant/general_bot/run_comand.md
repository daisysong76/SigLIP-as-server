Start the backend:
node api/index.js

Start the Python AI agent:
python3 agent/generalist_agent.py


Access the frontend:
Open http://localhost:8080 in your browser, input the phone number and instruction, and start the call.

Check logs:

Twilio Dashboard: Verify call activity.
Backend console: Ensure real-time logs for WebSocket connections and AI responses.


Fix:
Double-check the API URL:

Open your browser and visit https://calltool2-684089940295.us-west2.run.app/api/create-call.
If the page doesn’t load, the issue is likely with the URL or the API server.
Fix DNS/Network Configuration:

Ensure your machine is connected to the internet.
Try flushing the DNS cache:
sudo dscacheutil -flushcache; sudo killall -HUP mDNSResponder
If the API is internal (not publicly accessible):

Make sure you’re connected to the appropriate network or VPN.
Test API Resolution: Run:
ping calltool2-684089940295.us-west2.run.app
If it fails, the issue is with the network or the server.
