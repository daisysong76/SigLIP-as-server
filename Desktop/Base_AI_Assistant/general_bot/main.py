# python integrations/phone_call_handler.py
# Trigger a Phone Call:
# You can use Twilio's dashboard to connect a phone call to http://localhost:5000/start_call.


# Next Steps
# Replace placeholders for the speech recognition and reasoning models with production APIs.
# Persist conversation history across sessions if needed using a database.
# Add exception handling and improve robustness for real-world interactions.
# By following this architecture, your generative boat (AI agent) will be able to interact dynamically with users during phone calls and drive meaningful conversations based on its reasoning capabilities.
