Summary of Inference Pipeline Enhancements

Below is a concise overview of four key optimizations that transform a CPU-only LLaVA embedding test into a production-quality multimodal inference pipeline:
Low-Bit Quantization (bitsandbytes + accelerate)
  Shrinks model size by 4× (FP16→4-bit), cutting load times from ~30 s to <5 s.
  Leverages QNNPACK/FBGEMM CPU kernels for near-GPU throughput and enables memory-constrained edge deployments.

ONNX Runtime with Static Quantization
  Exports the vision-encoder + LLM head to ONNX, applies static quant (QOperator), and runs on optimized CPU backends (DNNL/OpenVINO).
  Ensures sub-second model loading and consistent, cross-platform performance in development and production.

Combined Impact
  Load Time: ≤5 s for a 7 B-param model on x86 CPU
  Latency: <200 ms per micro-batch of 2 embeddings
  Cost: Up to 5× cheaper CPU inference vs. GPU pods
  Developer Velocity: Rapid local feedback loops and automated performance guards

These enhancements ensure your embedding-to-response workflow is fast, reliable, and cost-effective—meeting the stringent SLAs of today’s real-time AI services.

Asynchronous Micro-Batching of Embeddings
  Groups 2–4 embeddings per inference call via ThreadPoolExecutor or asyncio, hiding Python overhead behind kernel execution.
  Boosts end-to-end throughput and reduces per-request latency, critical for real-time multimodal applications.

CPU-Only Profiling & CI Time-Gate
  Integrates PyTorch’s CPU Profiler for detailed hotspot analysis (operator, I/O, Python wiring).
  Implements CI checks that fail early if the end-to-end test exceeds a defined SLA (e.g. 60 s), preventing performance regressions.
