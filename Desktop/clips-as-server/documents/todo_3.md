Goal | Best Model | Why
Image captioning + Dialog (Multi-Agent Planning) | LLaVA | LLaVA natively does caption + chat + multi-turn dialog, with vision grounding.
Zero-shot similarity search (Embedding retrieval at scale) | SigLIP | SigLIP has better image-text retrieval embeddings than even CLIP/BLIP-2.
Layout/document visual reasoning (tables, slides, receipts) | Kosmos-2.5 | Kosmos-2.5 understands image+text layout better (but it's slower and heavier).


‚úÖ LLaVA is the best first step because:

You need caption generation (images ‚Üí text).
You need dialog / multi-turn reasoning (agent workflows).
You need vision + language joint embedding.
‚úÖ Later, SigLIP can complement LLaVA if:

You want faster and higher-accuracy retrieval (for vector search over many images).
‚úÖ You don't need Kosmos-2.5 unless:

You are doing document-heavy tasks (e.g., invoice OCR, UI understanding).


How Pros Use Them Together (2025 knowledge)

Top-tier companies (OpenAI, DeepMind, Google DeepMind's Gemini) do this:


Stack	Usage
SigLIP / CLIP	Fast visual retrieval first (cheap embedding search).
LLaVA / Flamingo / MiniGPT-4	After retrieval, use high-quality multimodal reasoning.
Optional: Kosmos-2.5 / DocLLMs	If input is a document or UI, specialize there.


Advanced Model	Comments
LLaVA-NeXT	LLaVA upgraded with even better visual grounding, future-proof for multimodal agents.
Otter-2	Another open-source agent, combines image + audio + video better.
XComposer	Adds "visual imagination" + text generation abilities.


Model	Creator	Short Summary
SigLIP (Sigmoid Loss CLIP)	Google DeepMind	CLIP upgraded: uses sigmoid loss (not contrastive softmax), improves fine-grained matching in vision-language.
DINOv2	Meta AI	Self-supervised pure vision model (no language), super strong at representation learning ‚Äî best features for image retrieval, detection, classification.


‚úÖ If your project is still CLIP-based (BLIP-2, LLaVA, MiniGPT-4 style):
‚Üí Use SigLIP instead of CLIP for better matching and retrieval.

‚úÖ Later, if you need ultra-strong vision-only features (e.g., for retrieval, segmentation, detection tasks):
‚Üí Use DINOv2 to replace the visual backbone or pre-extract features



‚ö° Ultra-Advanced Setup (if you want top-tier agent):


Component	Model
Vision Encoder	DINOv2 (for strong vision understanding)
Vision‚ÄìLanguage Linker	SigLIP (for text ‚ÜîÔ∏è image grounding)
Language Head	LLaMA / DeepSeek LLM / Claude 3 Haiku
Then connect them into multi-agent reasoning (e.g., Tree-of-Thoughts, ReAct, GraphRAG).

If you modularize the vision encoder (like plug-and-play modules), your project will become:

üî• Flexible (easy to upgrade from CLIP ‚Üí SigLIP ‚Üí DINOv2 ‚Üí others)
üöÄ Future-proof (can adapt new encoders easily without rewriting code)
üß† Multi-agent ready (different agents could choose the best encoder for their task)
