# Research Plan: Multimodal Agent for Automatic Captioning, Ad Copy Generation, and Publishing Decisions

## Title
**AdAgent++: A Vision-Language Planning Agent for Automatic Ad Copy Generation and Safety-Aware Publishing**

## 1. Objective
Design a modular multimodal AI agent that:
- Takes an image input
- Generates a caption (visual-language understanding)
- Creates persuasive ad copy (language generation)
- Evaluates emotional tone, fairness, and engagement likelihood
- Makes an autonomous publishing decision (approve/edit/reject)


## 2. System Components

### 2.1 Visual Encoder
- **BLIP-2**: To generate rich captions and extract multimodal embeddings.
- **Scene Graph Generator (Optional Phase 2)**: ViLD or MDETR to extract object relations.

### 2.2 Reasoning & Planning
- **LLaMA 3 / Vicuna** (or OpenFlamingo optionally):
  - Text-based reasoning agent.
  - Given caption + tags, generate multi-style ad copy (persuasive, informative, emotional).

- **LangGraph** / **Tree-of-Thought**:
  - Implement multi-step decision making.
  - Self-evaluate alternative outputs before acting.

### 2.3 Multi-Agent Collaboration
- **Captioning Agent**
- **Marketing Agent**
- **Safety/Compliance Agent**
- **Publishing Approver Agent**

Agents interact to validate content quality, safety, and strategic alignment.


### 2.4 Evaluation
- **CLIPScore, BERTScore** for automatic similarity assessment.
- **Engagement Predictor**: Fine-tuned lightweight model to simulate click/view prediction.
- **Human-Like Review**: Optional GPT-4 evaluation for creativity, emotional tone, and factuality.


## 3. Innovation Points
- Integration of vision-grounded LLM reasoning for content generation.
- Fairness and bias detection embedded in publishing workflows.
- Self-improving agent with feedback memory for reinforcement learning.
- Modular architecture supporting plug-and-play model upgrades (CLIP -> BLIP-2 -> Flamingo).


## 4. Milestones
| Phase | Deliverable |
|------|-------------|
| 1 | Working BLIP-2 + LLaMA caption-to-ad copy pipeline |
| 2 | Add multi-agent loop using LangGraph/AutoGen |
| 3 | Scene graph enrichment (optional) |
| 4 | Safety/fairness evaluation layer |
| 5 | Reinforcement learning from simulated feedback |


## 5. Key Research Questions
- How does multimodal scene understanding affect content generation quality?
- Can structured agent planning outperform one-shot prompting for real-world ad tasks?
- How to balance creativity and compliance automatically?
- What biases emerge in vision-language ad pipelines, and how can agents mitigate them?


## 6. Deployment Targets
- API-based service using FastAPI or gRPC.
- Scalable Docker/Kubernetes deployment.
- Streamlit or lightweight UI frontend for demo.


## 7. Stretch Goals
- Live user feedback loop (A/B testing)
- Personalization agent (adjust ad style per user cluster)
- Multilingual support (English -> Spanish, Chinese, etc.)
