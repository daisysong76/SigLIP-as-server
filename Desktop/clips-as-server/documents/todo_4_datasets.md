Suggested Testing Strategy:

Phase	Datasets
Phase 1	Flickr30K (✅ you already did)
Phase 2	Add Conceptual 12M and COCO Captions (medium scale)
Phase 3	Add LAION-400M (streaming) for stress-testing
Optional	Add WIT for multilingual, NoCaps for zero-shot evaluation



Dataset	Size	Why use it?	Where to get
LAION-400M	🔥 400M	Massive, real-world noisy web data. Matches CLIP/SigLIP training.	HuggingFace / AWS public
WIT (Wikipedia Image-Text)	🌍 Multilingual	Wikipedia images with multilingual captions. Tests language generalization.	HuggingFace (google/wit)
Conceptual Captions 12M	🖼️ 12M	High-quality web images, diverse topics. Less noisy than LAION.	HuggingFace (conceptual_12m)
COCO Captions	🎯 ~120K	Gold standard for image-captioning. Ground-truth style captions.	HuggingFace (coco_captions)
NoCaps	✨ Small	Tests zero-shot captioning abilities on novel concepts.	HuggingFace (nocaps)
