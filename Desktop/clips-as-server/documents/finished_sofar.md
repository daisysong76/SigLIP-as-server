Accomplished so far with the CLIP service:
Set up Redis for persistent caching
Completed the FAISS/Qdrant integration
Implementing the unified search endpoint
Adding the reranking pipeline


âœ… Strong Points:
Well-structured Project Organization:
Clear separation of concerns (api, models, inference, monitoring, etc.)
Proper modular architecture
Following Python best practices
Robust Inference Pipeline (inference/pipeline.py):
Efficient batch processing
Caching mechanism
Async support for both text and image processing
Error handling and logging
Performance monitoring
GPU/CPU device management
Comprehensive Dependencies:
All necessary ML libraries (torch, transformers, faiss-cpu)
FastAPI for web service
Development tools (black, flake8, pre-commit)
Monitoring and optimization tools
Strong Main Application (main.py):
Clean configuration management
Command-line argument parsing
Server setup with FastAPI
Multiple run modes (server, worker, benchmark)
Proper logging setup
ðŸš§ Areas Needing Implementation:
Configuration Files:
Need to implement config/config.yaml
Need to implement config/logging.yaml
Need to implement config/models.yaml
API Layer:
Need to implement api/app.py
Need to implement API routers (embeddings, search, health)
Model Management:
Need to implement models/registry.py
Need to implement model loaders
Optimization:
Need to implement quantization
Need to implement compilation optimizations
Need to implement profiling
Monitoring:
Need to implement metrics collection
Need to implement tracing
Need to implement dashboard
Deployment:
Need to implement Docker configuration
Need to implement Kubernetes manifests
Need to implement Makefile
Documentation:
Need to complete README.md
Need to add API documentation
Need to add deployment guide
Would you like me to help you implement any of these missing components? I can start with the most critical ones first, such as:
Configuration files
Model registry
API implementation
Docker/K8s setup
