When You Might Want More Than Just a Server
If your system grows, hereâ€™s what you might add or consider:

1. CLIP Server + Caching Layer

Avoid re-encoding the same image or text repeatedly.
Use Redis, Faiss, or Qdrant to store and retrieve embeddings by hash.
2. CLIP Server + Retrieval Pipeline

Add RAG components: vector DBs, top-K filtering, rerankers.
Agents call a single /search endpoint that does the heavy lifting.
3. CLIP as a Tool in a Tool-Using Framework (e.g., AutoGen, LangGraph)

Register the CLIP server as a callable tool.
Agents reason, plan, and then invoke clip.embed(image) as part of their flow.
4. Distributed Embedding Microservices

For large-scale systems, you can shard across:
clip-server-text
clip-server-image
clip-server-video
All backed by queues or pub/sub
