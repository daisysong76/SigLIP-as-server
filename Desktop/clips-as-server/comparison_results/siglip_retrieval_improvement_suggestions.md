# Improving Base SigLIP Retrieval: Reranking and Other Methods

## Reranking with a Cross-Encoder (Recommended)
- Use a model like BLIP, ALBEF, or similar that takes both an image and a caption as input and outputs a matching score.
- For each image, take the top-K captions from the base model, and rerank them using the cross-encoder.
- This can boost Recall@1, especially for "hard" cases.

**Example (BLIP):**
```python
from transformers import BlipForImageTextRetrieval, BlipProcessor

blip_model = BlipForImageTextRetrieval.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-itm-base-coco").to(device)
blip_processor = BlipProcessor.from_pretrained("Salesforce/blip-itm-base-coco")

# For each image and its top-K candidate captions:
inputs = blip_processor(images=image, text=candidate_captions, return_tensors="pt", padding=True).to(device)
with torch.no_grad():
    scores = blip_model(**inputs).logits_per_image[:, 0]  # shape: (K,)
# Use scores to rerank the K candidates
```

## Other Methods to Improve Base Model Retrieval
- **Ensembling:** Average or combine the similarity scores from base and large models (if you can afford to run both).
- **Query expansion:** Use synonyms, paraphrases, or additional captions to increase the chance of a match.
- **Fine-tuning:** If you have labeled (image, caption) pairs, fine-tune the base model on your specific data.
- **Hard negative mining:** During training or fine-tuning, include "hard" negatives (very similar but incorrect captions) to sharpen the model.

## What NOT to Do
- Don't use a text–text reranker (like `cross-encoder/ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`) for image–text retrieval. It will not help and may hurt.

## Summary Table
| Method                | Will it help? | How to do it?                        |
|-----------------------|:-------------:|--------------------------------------|
| Cross-encoder rerank  |      ✔️       | Use BLIP, ALBEF, etc.                |
| Text–text reranker    |      ❌       | Not suitable for image–text          |
| Ensembling            |      ✔️       | Combine base+large model scores      |
| Query expansion       |      ✔️       | Add paraphrases, synonyms            |
| Fine-tuning           |      ✔️       | Use labeled data                     |
