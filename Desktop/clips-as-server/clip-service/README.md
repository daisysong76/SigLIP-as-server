Production Deployment Steps

Infrastructure provisioning
Deploy Kubernetes cluster with GPU nodes (A100/H100 preferred)
Set up high-performance NVMe storage for vector indexes
Configure networking with optimized GPU-aware routing


Model preparation
Optimize CLIP model with knowledge distillation
Create TensorRT engines with mixed precision
Deploy model artifacts to distributed cache


Service deployment
Roll out inference microservices
Configure auto-scaling based on GPU utilization
Enable distributed tracing and monitoring


Load testing and optimization
Perform continuous load testing at various scales
Tune batch sizes and timeouts based on traffic patterns
Optimize memory usage for maximum throughput


Production validation
Validate embedding quality against benchmarks
Verify latency SLAs under various load conditions
Test failover and high-availability capabilities
