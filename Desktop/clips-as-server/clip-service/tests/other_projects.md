Let me search for similar open-source projects that work with CLIP embeddings and Redis caching:

Ran tool
Based on my search, there are several similar open-source projects that align with your project's goals. Here are the most relevant ones:

1. **CLIP-Text-Image-Retrieval** (https://github.com/sjy0727/CLIP-Text-Image-Retrieval)
- Most similar to your project
- Uses CLIP for text-to-image retrieval
- Implements Redis caching and Milvus vector database
- Features:
  - Text-to-image retrieval
  - Vector indexing with Milvus
  - Redis caching optimization
  - ONNX inference acceleration
  - Achieves high performance metrics (98% R@1 on Mini-ImageNet)

2. **video-qa-semantic-vector-caching** (https://github.com/redis-developer/video-qa-semantic-vector-caching)
- Uses Redis for vector caching
- Implements semantic search with LangChain and OpenAI
- Focuses on video content but uses similar vector caching principles

3. **image-similarity-search** (https://github.com/oguzhantasimaz/image-similarity-search)
- Uses CLIP with Upstash Vector for image similarity search
- Simpler implementation but demonstrates core concepts
- Good example of vector database integration

4. **imbedding** (https://github.com/harperreed/imbedding)
- Flask service for CLIP embeddings with GPU acceleration
- Features:
  - GPU-optimized processing
  - Docker containerization
  - REST API interface
  - Configurable model selection

Your project appears to be more comprehensive than most of these implementations, particularly in terms of:
- Advanced caching strategies
- Performance optimization
- CPU/GPU handling
- Streaming capabilities
- Robust error handling

However, you might find useful patterns or optimizations in these projects, especially:
- CLIP-Text-Image-Retrieval's Milvus integration
- video-qa-semantic-vector-caching's Redis implementation
- imbedding's GPU acceleration approach

Would you like me to dive deeper into any particular aspect of these projects that interests you?
